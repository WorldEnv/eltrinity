# ElTrinity
- Program and run at realtime with eltrinity

# Supported languages
- [X] Bean shell (Simple Java)
- [ ] C Language

# How it works
EL Trinity uses BeanShell Interpreter to run beanshell
and uses [c2bsh](https://github.com/trindadedev13/eltrinity/tree/main/src/c2bsh/)
to convert C Lang code to BeanShell/Java and runs it as Beanshell with beanshell interpreter.
